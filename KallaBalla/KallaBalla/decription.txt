KallaBalla (kʌl.ʌ bʌl.ʌ)
Proving the existence of God. (Equalizing the color space of map tiles, by the way.)

History:
On the first day, he created significant color differences in map tiles taken from different satellites, in varying light conditions and seasons. 
On the second day, he created the eagerness to equalize it programmatically.
On the third day, he created misconception.
On the fourth day, he created bugs.
On the fifth day, he created inductive reasoning (along with false positives).
On the sixth day, he created Club-Mate.
On the seventh day, he created a program explaining the relationship between an infinite, eternal and essentially unknowable Creator with the finite and mortal universe of His creation (and of course equalizing map tiles as well).

How to use it:
1. In the "Equalizer Passes" panel select conversion passes one by one (enjoy description & visualization).
2. Press "animate" to see the whole conversion process gradually visualized.
3. Experience divine enlightenment.
