Laser cutter driver and control panel
=====================================

Ctrl-Cut is an initiative to produce Open Source toolchain for talking
to laser cutters without being restricted to proprietary drivers and
the chosen operating system of the laser cutter vendor.

Initially, this is targetted Epilog laser cutters.

Laser cutters from Epilog are fantastic devices. Unfortunately, Epilog
forces us to use their Microsoft Windows-only laser cutter drivers. In
addition, they only support Corel Draw as an application from which
you can run jobs (other tools might work but are not supported).

There are also multiple other shortcomings of the Epilog drivers,
which we will elaborate on later.

To remedy this, we are writing our own drivers, which will run on both
Linux and Mac OS X (and any other system supporting CUPS).

Currently, we only support Epilog Legend 36EXT, but we aim to support
other backends as well.

Please get in touch if you want to help out by developing, testing,
documenting or supplying information about other laser cutters.
