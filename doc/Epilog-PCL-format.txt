HPGL commands:
--------------

Note: Alle coordinates are given in positive integers in "x,y" format,
where the origin is the upper left corner of the lazzzor, as well as the
document. Coordinates are 600 DPI integers.

Epilog-specific:
YP [power]       (e.g. YP080)                                           Vector power
ZS [speed]       (e.g. ZS033)                                           Vector speed
XR [freq]        (e.g. XR5000)                                          Vector freq.
