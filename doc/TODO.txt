Zing support:
-------------

o Test how DPI setting in the Windows driver dialog affects PCL (HPGL) vector output
o Create Zing PPD (generate PPDs and maintain source files)
o Manage coordinates and bed size correctly
o Refactor test framework to be able to deal with Zing-specific tests
o Test Zing raster

CUPS:
-----
o Generate EpilogLegend36EXT.ppd with ppdc
  This should open up for easy generation of PPD's for any Epilog other laser

Postscript:
-----------
o Make sure the line width which distinguishes cutting and engraving is well-defined.
  See test-data/corel-r/12233.cdr for an example where this is a problem.

Installer:
----------


Filter:
-------
o Write a svg frontend
o Use stdint everywhere
o Find out how to control the auto focus touch off point precisely

Testing:
--------
o Rewrite regression compare to be able to detect how much polylines, length, move etc.
  changed. This should enable us to color-code the output correctly.
  Probably need to rewrite it in python or smth.
o rtlinfo: Summarize laser parameters
o Test which laser parameters affect actual coordinates in the RTL output

Goodies:
--------
o Automatically trace stencils from raster images
o Estimate cutting time
o Specialized dithering option that optimizes for plain filled areas.
