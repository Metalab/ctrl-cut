- Test Structure
  - Test
    - Every test resides in a distinct directory and has at least one case associated with it
    - The directory name denotes the test name.
    - It contains a mandatory ".cases" file which configures which case should be run at which test level
    - It contains the source file from which all reference jobs of all cases have been generated from
  - Cases 
    - Every case is a sub directory in a test directory.
    - The directory name denotes the case name.
    - It contains a postscript file (the source model) and a prn file (the reference job).
    - Optionally it may contain a ".options" file which controls the ctrl-cut processing options of the test case.
  - Test Levels
    - Test levels are configured in the tests ".cases" file. 
    - There are 4 levels (quick, normal, more and all) which map to a space delimited list of cases to run at that level.
  - Test output
    - All test output will be put into the out directory in the test directory.
    - For every case that has been run there is a directory generated that contains corresponding test results and logs.

- Example:
sometest
  sometest.cdr

  .cases
      <code>
      quick 75
      normal 300
      more 300 600
      all 75 300 600
      </code>

  quickcase
    quickcase.ps
    quickcase.prn
    .options
      <code>
      Resolution=75 VectorOptimize=Inner-Outer
      </code>

  slowcase
    slowcase.ps
    slowcase.prn
    .options
