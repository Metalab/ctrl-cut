How to run tests:
=================

./cc test-any                  # Run all tests
./cc test-any test-data/<dir>  # Run all tests in <dir>
./cc test-any <filename.ps>    # Run the specified test

How to add new test cases:
==========================

Prerequisites:

o Make sure the EpilogCapture printer is installed
  lpadmin -p EpilogCapture -E -v file:///tmp/epilogcapture.ps -P etc/ppd/EpilogCapture.ppd

QCad:
-----

o Make sure to set the Pen width of all layers to 0.00 mm
  (in View->Toolbars->Layer List->Edit Layer)
o Save DXF to test-data/qcad/<testcase>.dxf
o Print to EpilogCapture
o copy /tmp/epilogcapture.ps to test-data/qcad/<testcase>.ps
o The test will be automatically run by test-any.
  To test now, run ./cc test-any test-data/qcad/<testcase>.ps

Inkscape:
---------

o Set up the LaserBed paper size in Inkscape:
  cp doc/LaserBed.svg <templatedir>
  templatedir:
  Mac OS X: /Applications/Inkscape.app/Contents/Resources/templates
  Linux: ~/.inkscape/templates or /usr/share/inkscape/template
o Make sure to se the stroke width to <= 0.025 mm
  (in Object->Fill and Stroke->Stroke Style)
o Save Inkscape SVG to test-data/inkscape/<testcase>.svg
o Print to EpilogCapture
o copy /tmp/epilogcapture.ps to test-data/inkscape/<testcase>.ps
o The test will be automatically run by test-any.
  To test now, run ./cc test-any test-data/inkscape/<testcase>.ps

o Manually inspect test-data/inkscape/<testcase>.raw.pdf and test-data/inkscape/<testcase>.raw.svg
o If these look OK, cp <testcase>.raw <testcase>.prn and commit in the prn file.

Gimp:
-----

o File->Page Setup:
  - Format for: EpilogCapture
  - Paper size: LaserBed (36x24 in.)
  - Orientation: Portrait
o File->Print:
  - General->Printer: EpilogCapture
  - Image Settings:
    o X & Y resolution: 600 pixels/in (or adjust this to change physical engraved size)
    o Position: Left=0, Right=0
    o Center: None
o copy /tmp/epilogcapture.ps to test-data/Gimp/<testcase>.ps

o Manually inspect test-data/Gimp/<testcase>.raw.pbm
o If these look OK, cp <testcase>.raw <testcase>.prn and commit in the prn file.
    
Corel Draw:
-----------

Prerequisites:
- Set up lazzzor page size
- Helpful: Set lazzor page size as default
- Install Epilog drivers

o Draw shape as normal for laser cutting
o Save corel draw file -> copy to test-data/corel/ as .cdr
o Print to file using "Generic PostScript Printer"
  - NB! It's important to take note of the following!
  - Printing to "Device Independent PostScript File" doesn't work
  - The "Generic PostScript Printer" can be installed from here:
    http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/thankyou.jsp?ftpID=1500&fileID=1438
  - Check "Use PPD" -> Use etc/ppd/EpilogPostscript.ppd
  - Uncheck "Misc->Apply ICC profile"
  - copy to test-data/corel/ as .ps
o Print to file using Epilog driver (or to lazzzor-capture printer)
o Settings:
  - Auto Focus on
  - Vector speed = 33
  - Vector power = 80
  - Vector freq = 1053
  - Vector Sorting on
  - NB! If any of the settings are changed, this must be encoded into a
    <testcase>.options file and put in test-data/corel/
o copy to test-data/corel/ as .prn
