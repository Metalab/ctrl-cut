test_LT-bug:

The Windows Epilog drivers has a bug which causes the "LT" which usually precedes the first PU command to be inserted into PCL instead of into HP-GL/2:
^[*b2MLT^[

test_clip-coords:

The Windows Epilog drivers has a bug which causes a polyline to have it's end X coordinate reduced by one point if it was clipped. This causes an otherwise continuous polyline to be chopped up, resulting in extra PU/PD commands.

twolines, test_startcut, test_xpos, test_xpos_inches, test_xpos_mm:

In this case, ghostscript will output the rightmost vector first,
giving us a different output than the corel drivers.
