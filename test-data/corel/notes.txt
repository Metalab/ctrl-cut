test_LT-bug:

The Windows Epilog drivers has a bug which causes the "LT" which usually precedes the first PU command to be inserted into PCL instead of into HP-GL/2:
^[*b2MLT^[

twolines:

In this case, ghostscript will output the rightmost vector first,
giving us a different output than the corel drivers.
